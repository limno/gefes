Aggregate "{{aggreate_short_name}}"
===================================

General Information
-------------------
This aggregate has the code `{{aggreate_short_name}}` and is named "{{aggreate_long_name}}". There are {{count_samples}} samples in this aggregate. Some summary information about them is given in table 1.

{{sample_table}}

-------

Processing
----------
This report (and all the analysis) was generated using the GEFES project at:

> <{{project_url}}>

Version `{{project_version}}` of the pipeline was used. The exact git hash of the latest commit was:

    {{git_hash}}

also more simply referred to by its shortened tag `{{git_tag}}`.

This document was generated at `{{now}}`.

A brief overview of what happens to the data can be viewed online here:

Co-Assembly
-----------
The first step is to take all reads from all samples in this aggregate and input them into an assembly algorithm. For this we use the "{{assembler_version}}" software with a kmer size of {{kmer_size}} and a contig length cutoff of {{contig_cutoff}} base pairs.

This results in the production of {{count_contigs}} contigs, of which the length distribution can be seen in figure \ref{contigs_len_dist}:

{{contigs_len_dist}}

-------

Binning
-------
The next step is to determine which of the {{count_contigs}} contigs are likely to belong together and are part of the same population. For this we use the "{{binning_version}}" software. This produces exactly {{count_bins}} different bins. Each bin containing varying number of contigs, we can plot a distribution as seen in in figure \ref{bins_size_dist}:

{{bins_size_dist}}

For further investigation please refer to the individual report of every bin.
