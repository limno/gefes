Bin "{{bin_short_name}}"
========================

General Information
-------------------
This bin is named "{{bin_name}}". It is part of the binning results from "{{binner_version}}" in the assembly "{{assembly_long_name}}" in the project "{{project_long_name}}" along with {{project_other_samples}} other bins. It is made up of {{bin_count_contigs}} different contigs.

Processing
----------
* This report (and all the analysis) was generated using the GEFES project at: <http://xapple.github.io/gefes/>

* Version `{{project_version}}` of the pipeline was used.

* This document was generated at `{{now}}`.

* The results and all the files generated for this sample can be found at:

    {{results_directory}}

{{#git}}
* The exact git hash of the latest commit was: {{git_hash}}

* Also more simply referred to by its shortened tag `{{git_tag}}`.
{{/git}}

Annotation
----------
Taking the {{sample_count_contigs}} contigs generated in the previous mono-assembly step, we will attempt annotation using the "{{annotation_version}}" software. This procedure predicts the presence of {{sample_count_proteins}} proteins. When possible, each protein is assigned a function. The most common functions are shown in the table below:
