## depth profiles of pfams

# the goal is to show metabolic trait distribution along the depth profiles in the three studied systems

As inputs we will use infomration on each contig - the genes each individual contig contains and the average coverage of each contig to estimate each individual genes distribution along the depth profile.

Next annotation of individual genes using pfam and tigrfam databases with hmmer will be used. Genes will be grouped according to these annotations and coverages will be summed up to obtain coverages per pfam and tigrfam.

Using a set of single copy pfams genome equivalence will be estimated for each pfam and tigrfam.

Using the set of reference pfams and tigrfams the depth distribution of these genes indicative for specific traits (e.g. methanotrophy, sulfate reduction) will be visualized for the three systems.
